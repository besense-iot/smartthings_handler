# Custom SmartThings Handler
New Smartthings Handler for:
* BeSense 360 Ceiling Sensor (IX32)
* BeSense PIR Wall Sensor (IX30)
* BeSense Window/Door Sensor (IM20)

Reports Motion, Battery, Tamper, and allows you to change the Alarm elimination Time.
Turn On/Off Motion LED option to save battery (Only for Firmware 18)


## Getting Started

Here are the instructions that should help you get the new custom handler

1. Log in here with the same username and password you use for your SmartThings app: [SmartThings Groovy IDE](https://consigliere-regional.api.smartthings.com)

2. Click on **My Device** Handlers in the top menu

3. In the top right corner, click on **Create new device handler** and choose **From code** from the top tab menu. You'll be presented with a blank area where you can copy the code from these links and paste it in (it's always best to use the raw version of the code)


* [Door/window sensor Code](https://github.com/besense-iot/smartthings_handler/blob/master/besense-door-window-sensor-zwave-plus.groovy)

* [Wall and Ceiling Sensor Code](https://github.com/besense-iot/smartthings_handler/blob/master/besense-motion-sensor-zwave-plus.groovy)

4. Next, scroll to the bottom and click Create. Now click Save, then click Publish > for me.

**You should now see this device type in your list of Device Handlers**
